    <img src="asian_selemon.jpeg" class="image"/>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Wild salmon is marinated and baked in an Asian-inspired soy and sesame sauce, served with hot cooked rice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds salmon fillets, with skin</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 cups long-grain white rice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried dill weed</li>
        <li>3 cups water</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make several shallow slashes in the skinless side of the salmon fillets. Place fillets skin-side down in a glass baking dish. In a medium bowl, whisk together the olive oil, rice vinegar, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, pepper, onion and sesame oil. Pour the liquid over the salmon, cover, and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the rice, water, and dill weed. Cover pan, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and cook 20 minutes, until rice is tender and water has been absorbed. Allow to stand for 5 minutes before removing lid and fluffing rice with a fork.        </li>
        <li>Remove cover from salmon, and bake the fish and the marinade for about 30 minutes, or until fish can be flaked with a fork. Serve salmon over the rice, and pour sauce over.</li>
    </ol>
